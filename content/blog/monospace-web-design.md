You've probably noticed that this site uses a monospace font everywhere. It's not just an aesthetic choice—it's a deliberate design decision that offers several benefits.

## Clarity and Readability

Monospace fonts were designed for reading code, which means they excel at:

- **Character distinction**: Each character is clearly different from others (0 vs O, 1 vs l vs I)
- **Consistent spacing**: Makes it easier to scan vertically
- **Low visual noise**: No elaborate serifs or flourishes to distract

## Connection to the Terminal

As a developer, I spend most of my day in a terminal. Using monospace on the web creates visual continuity between my work environment and my online presence.

It signals: "This is made by someone who thinks in code."

## Performance Benefits

System monospace fonts (`SF Mono`, `Consolas`, etc.) are already installed on most systems. This means:

- No web fonts to download
- Instant rendering
- Smaller page size
- Better privacy (no font CDN requests)

## The Text-First Web

Monospace fonts work particularly well for text-focused sites. They encourage:

- Shorter line lengths
- More whitespace
- Focus on content over decoration

## Not for Everyone

This approach isn't appropriate for all sites. Brand-heavy sites, marketing pages, and publications may need custom typography. But for personal sites, technical blogs, and documentation? Monospace is perfect.

Try it. Your readers (and your bandwidth) will thank you.
