My previous techniques to improve the workflow were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>reading command help,</li>\n<li>maintaining a list of useful snippets,</li>\n<li>asking AI to generate them on demand.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It all worked fine, but I noticed that I preferred to use the syntax that I already know, even though I knew there was a better way to do it. Why would I try to compose <code>git log --oneline --graph --decorate</code> if <code>git log</code> just works? Reading manuals was taking time, my commands cheat sheet needed constant updates, and AI was generating answers that were way too verbose.</p>\n<p>One day, I wrote a very detailed prompt so that an LLM outputs the essence, the raw answer to my question. I liked the result so I kept refining it. Eventually, I created a bash script and added a CLI alias to speed up my lookups. The result was very satisfying - I could type <code>iinfo how to check what is on 9000 port</code> into the terminal to get the <code>lsof -i :9000</code> answer. No unnecessary comments, no formatting. The output is ready to be copied and executed.</p>\n<p>I wrapped the script into a standalone CLI tool and published it on the NPM registry. Enjoy!</p>","excerpt":"Repo: github.com/frycz/info NPM: npmjs.com/package/@frycz/info Ask questions in natural language and get concise, formatted responses directly in your terminal…","frontmatter":{"title":"info","date":"December 23, 2025"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"info"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
