Angular was one of the few choices to create a production-grade app and React wasn't a thing yet.</p>\n<p>I remember that creating an app with pure JS was a nightmare and Angular made at least some of the pains go away. It allowed for creating more structured, complex architectures. While applications grew, soon, Angular's pain points grew as well. Bi-directional state sync and performance issues were the most common ones.</p>\n<p>Multiple other frameworks were created to solve the issues. A day without a new JS framework was a lost one. Among all these solutions, one in particular started getting popular - React.js.</p>\n<p>I was skeptical at first, how could I know if something better wouldn't be created the next day? Eventually, I decided to try it but I didn't want to build yet another todo app. That's why I built yet another notes app.</p>","excerpt":"Repo: github.com/frycz/quick-note Demo: quicknote-91c7d.firebaseapp.com/ Quick Note is a cloud-based app for creating, storing and sharing notes - very similar…","frontmatter":{"title":"quick-note","date":"November 24, 2024"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"quick-note"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
