Develop your project by adding changes and quickly pushing them with <code>atm s</code>. That's it.</p>\n<p>No need to visit github.com to create a private repo and set it up locally. No need for \"add\" -> \"commit\" -> \"push\" repetitive flow.</p>\n<h2>The Why</h2>\n<p>I like storing my side projects, even tiny ones, in private git repos. It provides a nice separation and makes the ideas accessible from anywhere.</p>\n<p>I wasn't always doing that though. I used to keep code in git repos locally on disks or even without any version control for single-file ideas. Time passed. Moving repos from one disk to another got tedious and single-file ideas became complex codebases. Then, I promised to myself that everything I create would go to GitHub.</p>\n<p>With all the AI models and tools around, I started creating more repos than usual. Going to GitHub to add yet another one started feeling repetitive, so I created a short script that used <code>gc</code> to setup a repo for me. Later, I added an alias to my terminal to quickly stage all local changes, commit them and push to GitHub.</p>\n<p>I have been using these two tools for a few months and I really like them. Following my new year resolution for 2025 to publish more stuff that I create, I decided to combine these two commands into a one and publish it.</p>\n<p>Feel free to try it and give some feedback. Enjoy!</p>","excerpt":"About Repo: github.com/frycz/atm NPM: npmjs.com/package/@frycz/atm In the era of AI tools, drafting new ideas is easier than ever. atm helps you set up private…","frontmatter":{"title":"atm","date":"December 20, 2025"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"atm"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
