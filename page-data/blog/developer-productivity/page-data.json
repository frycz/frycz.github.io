It's about removing friction from your workflow so you can focus on solving problems.</p>\n<h2>Automate Repetitive Tasks</h2>\n<p>If you do something more than twice, automate it. Shell aliases, scripts, and keyboard shortcuts add up:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\"># .bashrc / .zshrc\nalias gs='git status'\nalias gp='git push'\nalias gcm='git commit -m'\nalias serve='python3 -m http.server'\n</code></pre>\n<p>These save seconds each time, but over a year, that's hours of saved typing.</p>\n<h2>Keep a Engineering Log</h2>\n<p>I keep a simple markdown file for each project:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">## 2024-05-12\n\n- Fixed bug in user authentication (issue #234)\n- Investigated slow query performance on reports table\n- Next: Implement caching layer for frequently accessed data\n</code></pre>\n<p>This helps me:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Resume work quickly after interruptions</li>\n<li>Remember why I made certain decisions</li>\n<li>Write better commit messages and documentation</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Master Your Editor</h2>\n<p>Learn the keyboard shortcuts for your editor. The most impactful ones:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Multi-cursor editing</li>\n<li>Quick file navigation</li>\n<li>Find and replace with regex</li>\n<li>Integrated terminal</li>\n<li>Git integration</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Spend 10 minutes a week learning a new feature. In a year, you'll be exponentially faster.</p>\n<h2>Take Breaks</h2>\n<p>Counterintuitive but true: regular breaks make you more productive. When stuck on a problem:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Step away from the computer</li>\n<li>Go for a walk or grab coffee</li>\n<li>Come back with fresh eyes</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Often the solution appears when you're not actively thinking about it.</p>\n<h2>Say No More Often</h2>\n<p>The most productive thing you can do is avoid unnecessary work:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Does this feature really need to be built?</li>\n<li>Can we solve this with existing tools?</li>\n<li>Is this the simplest possible solution?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Every feature you don't build is time saved on development, testing, documentation, and maintenance.</p>","excerpt":"Productivity isn't about working more hours or typing faster.
