It's not just an aesthetic choice—it's a deliberate design decision that offers several benefits.</p>\n<h2>Clarity and Readability</h2>\n<p>Monospace fonts were designed for reading code, which means they excel at:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Character distinction</strong>: Each character is clearly different from others (0 vs O, 1 vs l vs I)</li>\n<li><strong>Consistent spacing</strong>: Makes it easier to scan vertically</li>\n<li><strong>Low visual noise</strong>: No elaborate serifs or flourishes to distract</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Connection to the Terminal</h2>\n<p>As a developer, I spend most of my day in a terminal. Using monospace on the web creates visual continuity between my work environment and my online presence.</p>\n<p>It signals: \"This is made by someone who thinks in code.\"</p>\n<h2>Performance Benefits</h2>\n<p>System monospace fonts (<code>SF Mono</code>, <code>Consolas</code>, etc.) are already installed on most systems. This means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No web fonts to download</li>\n<li>Instant rendering</li>\n<li>Smaller page size</li>\n<li>Better privacy (no font CDN requests)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The Text-First Web</h2>\n<p>Monospace fonts work particularly well for text-focused sites. They encourage:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shorter line lengths</li>\n<li>More whitespace</li>\n<li>Focus on content over decoration</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Not for Everyone</h2>\n<p>This approach isn't appropriate for all sites. Brand-heavy sites, marketing pages, and publications may need custom typography. But for personal sites, technical blogs, and documentation? Monospace is perfect.</p>\n<p>Try it. Your readers (and your bandwidth) will thank you.</p>","excerpt":"You've probably noticed that this site uses a monospace font everywhere.
